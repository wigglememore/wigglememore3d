  <h2>Changes from stock VzBot 330</h2>
  <p>I made a number of changes from the <a class="inline-link" href="https://github.com/VzBoT3D/VzBoT-Vz330">stock VzBot</a> created by Simon Vez, partly to suit me better, partly for fun.  They are all summarised below with detailed explanations, pictures and links further down the page.</p>
  <p>
  <ul>
    <li>Only retained the xy-motion system, lid and enclosure</li>
    <li>Replaced the z-axis with a modified version of the <a class="inline-link" href="https://github.com/RoyBerntsenDesign/Project-Valkyrie">Project Valkyrie</a> belted triple-z</li>
    <li>Created a thinner version of the VzBot frame brace because the full size ones interfere with the z-axis linear rails</li>
    <li>Added an electronics enclsoure with matched VzBot doors and extended the lid to cover this, custom hinges for both following the VzBot theme</li>
    <li>Created a new motor tensioner backplate to fit with the electronics enclosure</li>
    <li>Merged the changes of 'VzBot modified eva' to Eva 2.4 and made additional changes to the belt grabbers on the front to better match the x-y gantry idler heights</li>
    <li>Adapted back to fit CPAP cooling from karnadi#6627 on the Discord, and modified their design to fit the 15mm ID CPAP tubing</li>
    <li>Changed cable holder stand on Eva back plate and made a new cable holder to hold the wiring and CPAP tube</li>
    <li>Printed y-gantry and idler mounts adjusted to use 5mm dia, M4 shoulder bolts</li>
    <li>Printed y-gantry adjusted to match the carbon-fibre tube dimensions (since they have a large manufacturing tolerance), same adjustment to tube end-caps</li>
    <li>More to come...</li>
  </ul>
