  <p>Welcome to my website where I will document my journey through 3D printing</p>
  <p>My name is Matt and I work as a CFD engineer in my day job.  I spend lots of my spare time in the shed woodworking, or on a mill or lathe at my local makespace.  I recently (depending on how often I update this website) purchased a Creality Ender 5 Pro, and decided to document my journey through building, calibrating and modding in a simple website hosted here on GitHub.</p>
  <p>The aim of this website is to help guide anyone using this printer by recording all of the failures and successes I have, and how I deal with issues that arise along the way.</p>
  <p>I used to have some pages here about the basics of 3D printing, and information on calibration, but you can find everthing you need on Youtube by (in no particular order) Teaching Tech, Maker's Muse, CNC Kitchen and Thomas Sanladerer, and Teaching Tech's <a class="inline-link" href="https://teachingtechyt.github.io/index.html">calibration website</a> has everything you need to set up and tune your 3D printer to perfection.</p>
