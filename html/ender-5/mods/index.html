        <p>Mods that I have designed, modelled and (possibly) published</p>
        <button class="accordion">Top mounted extruder</button>
        <div class="panel">
          <p>I was having stringing and clogging issues (which I later discovered were nothing to do with my retraction settings, so this mod, whilst cool, is possibly not necessary)
            so decided to top mount my extruder to significantly reduce the bowden tube length.  There is one solution on thingiverse, however it has two main issues: some people reported
            problems with overheating (and hence skipping) of the stepper, as it is usually fixed to the aluminium frame which can act as a heat sink; secondly, when the print
            head is homed, the bowden tube has a very small radius, possible leading to filament feeding issues.  I designed my own mount which incorporates a short piece of 2060 
            extrusion to fix the overheating issues, and mounts centrally on the top-rear frame, angled upwards, to minimise both length and movement of the bowden tube.  I have also
            incorporated cable management for the main cable runs.  My e-stepper wire was just too short to reach in the standard configuration, but this was fixed with the 
            electronics box relocation mod.</p>

        <button class="accordion">New PSU and mounts</button>
        <div class="panel">
          <p>The 350W PSU that came with my Ender 5 was not MeanWell, and did not inspire confidence (although I'm sure it would have kept working fine), and was noisy.  
             I decided to replace it with a passively cooled unit, eliminating one of the fans from the system.  I also took the opportunity to increase the capacity to 600W 
             (I know, completely overkill) as I have future mods planned which will require more power.  Since it is passively cooled it has to be mounted externally, so I 
             designed and printed some covers to house the wiring, switch and power socket.  I wired everything up with 14AWG wire, including new runs to the printers 
             mainboard, using crimped quick-disconnect (plug and switch), ring (PSU terminals) and ferrule (mainboard terminals) connectors for strength and durability.  
            I chose the <a href="https://www.meanwell-web.com/en-gb/ac-dc-single-output-industrial-power-supply-with-hep--600--24">MeanWell HEP-600-24</a>.</p>

        <div class="panel">
          <p>A <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4128533">remix</a> of the <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3479330">original super-strut</a> by 
            <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/driestone/designs">DrieStone</a> which, in additional to purely holding up the bed like an additional cantiliver, 
            braces diagonally from the bed to the linear bearings to provide what I think to be the stiffest bed support for the Ender 5.  Although even without them
            look at the first layer quality of this printer.</p>

            corner brackets help to stiffen the overall structure of the printer, ensuring walls are smooth and layers are consistent.</p>

        <div class="panel">
          <p>Mostly aesthetic, but it does give you better nozzle visibility for when you're levelling the bed.  There are many to choose from, and 
            <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4485125">this</a> version looked simple and still strong so is what I chose.  Initially I picked 
            <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4334403">this</a> as it's slightly prettier, however I couldn't find the link when I neeeded to print it
            and I've ended up very happy with the current solution.  A quick search on Thingiverse will give you all the options.

          <p>This mod provides much more flexibility for mounting and changing other components, and gives access to the electronics enclosure without having to 
             tip over the printer.  It is accomplished simply by printing four of <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3830464">these</a> brackets.</p>
