        <h1>Fun and Useful 3D Prints</h1>
        <p>This page will collect all the fun and useful things I have printed, including links, images and slicer settings.</p>
        <h2>Print settings</h2>
        <p>Most of these prints are made with eSun PLA+, printed at 208 degC with a 65 degC bed;  0.2mm resolution and a 0.4mm nozzle.  Any deviations from this, along with infil, supports and bed adhesion methods will be noted with the specific items.</p>
        <h2>Fun Prints - Prints that generally have no purpose but are super cool</h2>
        <h3>My Brain</h3>
        <p>I recently had an MRI scan (don't worry, I'm fine) and I thought it would be super cool to 3D print my brain.  Instructions are available <a class="inline-link" href="../guides/3D_brain_from_mri/index.html">here</a>
        but the results are super impressive.  This is only a 50% scale print to test the stl quality and check the support structure and interface, the final model at 100% scale will be printed in
        eSun Marble PLA</p>

        <h3>Hex-drive screwdriver handle</h3>
        <p>For a long time I was having to wind the bed of my printer all the way down to change the nozzle as all my screwdrivers were so long.  This print from thingiverse solved all my troubles, looks super cool, and can accept any hex-drive screwdriver bit. Printed at 15% infil with a brim for bed adhesion and no supports</p>

        <h3>3D Benchy Photo Studio</h3>
        <p>Test prints were everywhere; on my desk, on my ottoman, on my bookshelves, on the floor, on the printer.  
          This photo set-up let me take repeatable photos of all the test prints so I would have a clear test-print history and less clutter around the house.</p>
        <h3>Dibber</h3>
        <p>I have a friend with an allotment, and come the last frost of the year all their germinated seedlings need to be planted in the ground.
          To do this, they have to create consistent small holes for transplantation, and a dibber is the tool for the job.  They also happen to be Star Wars fans.</p>
